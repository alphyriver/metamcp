-- Gateway activity history — the durable record behind the Live Logs page.
--
-- Until this table the Live Logs view rendered ONE source: an in-memory ring
-- buffer of 2000 entries (`lib/metamcp/log-store.ts`) that is gone the moment
-- the process restarts. Connection attempts, client sessions, backend stderr
-- and gateway lifecycle events had no durable home anywhere in the product, so
-- the two questions the page exists to answer — "was this failing yesterday
-- too?" and "who was connected when it broke?" — could not be answered at all
-- once the buffer rolled or the container was replaced.
--
-- SCOPE, and why `tool_call` is missing from the category list. Tool calls are
-- already persisted, per call, by migration 0019's `tool_call_audit`. Mirroring
-- them here would double the write rate on the busiest event class in the
-- gateway to store a strictly poorer copy (no params hash, no latency, no
-- namespace). The writer filters that category out; this table covers the
-- ACTIVITY events that had no durable home, not the ones that already do.
--
-- RELATIONSHIP TO `audit_log` (migration 0028). Deliberately a third table
-- rather than more rows in that one. `audit_log` is the control-plane SECURITY
-- record: who authenticated, what was refused, which credential was presented,
-- and it is append-only forever with no prune path at all. This table is
-- OPERATIONAL history: connection churn, session opens, backend output. It is
-- high-volume, it is mostly `info`, and it is meant to age out. Merging them
-- would either force security rows to inherit a retention policy or force
-- reconnect noise to be kept forever, and the first of those is the one that
-- ends badly.
--
-- Idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS / CREATE OR REPLACE / DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS) per
-- fork convention. Journal "when" (1787097600000) deliberately exceeds every
-- earlier entry: drizzle applies only entries whose "when" is above the max
-- already applied, and a misordered one is SILENTLY SKIPPED — the table would
-- simply never exist in production and nothing would fail loudly. See
-- UMBRELLA_FORK.md's migration-ordering note.

	-- timestamp and hands it back to fetch the next page. That value round-trips
	-- through a JavaScript Date, which cannot represent anything finer than a

	-- therefore slightly EARLIER than the row it came from, so the next page's
	-- `<` comparison excludes every row sharing that millisecond — silently
	-- skipping rows, which is the exact failure keyset pagination exists to
	-- prevent. Storing what the contract can express removes the mismatch
	-- instead of papering over it in the query.

-- IMMUTABILITY WINDOW: 30 days, and the number is the requirement rather than
-- a tuning knob.
--
-- The operator requirement is at least 30 days of history that cannot be
-- rewritten or quietly trimmed, because the value of an activity log during an
-- investigation is exactly the part nobody could have edited afterwards. But
-- unlike `audit_log`, this table is high-volume operational noise and MUST age
-- out or it grows without bound, so "append-only forever" is not available
-- here.
--
-- The window is how both hold at once. Inside 30 days a row cannot be changed
-- or removed by anything — application, admin gesture, or hand-typed psql.
-- Outside 30 days a DELETE is permitted, which is the single opening the
-- retention sweeper uses.
--
-- UPDATE and TRUNCATE are refused unconditionally at every age. There is no
-- legitimate caller for either: nothing in the application updates a row it has
-- already written, and TRUNCATE is a one-statement path to exactly the outcome
-- this table exists to prevent. Only DELETE is age-gated, and only because
-- retention needs it.
--
-- The application half of the coupling lives in
-- `apps/backend/src/lib/gateway-events/retention.ts`, which floor-clamps
-- GATEWAY_EVENTS_RETENTION_DAYS to 30. If that floor is ever lowered below the
-- interval below, the sweeper's DELETE starts raising instead of pruning — the
-- failure is loud and the record survives, which is the correct direction for
-- the two to disagree in.
--
-- BREAK-GLASS, stated explicitly because "immutable" without an escape hatch
-- described is a promise someone eventually discovers the hard way. There IS
-- one, it requires a superuser, and using it is itself an audit-worthy act:
--
--   ALTER TABLE gateway_events DISABLE TRIGGER gateway_events_no_recent_delete;
--   -- or, for the session:  SET session_replication_role = 'replica';
--
-- That is the ONLY way to reclaim space inside the window, and nothing in the
-- application can reach it. Note in particular what a partial prune does: this
-- trigger raises per row, and a raise aborts the whole statement, so a DELETE
-- spanning the boundary rolls back completely and frees NOTHING rather than
-- trimming the aged part. Retention therefore cannot creep inward by degrees,
-- and an operator facing a full disk lowers GATEWAY_EVENTS_RETENTION_DAYS and
-- waits for the window to pass, or breaks the glass on purpose and says so.
--
-- The application connects as the cluster bootstrap superuser today, so a
-- `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` would be a no-op (superusers bypass grants) while a
-- trigger is not bypassed by privilege. Closing the remaining gap needs a
-- NOSUPERUSER runtime role; this is the interim and it is honest about it.
