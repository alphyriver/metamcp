// each carried whatever the framework left behind: no nosniff, no frame
// denial, no default CSP. Mounting it here gives them all the same baseline in
// one place. It sits BEFORE the routers on purpose: the OAuth router's own
// securityHeaders and the per-router helmet still run afterwards and override
// the specific headers they set (X-Frame-Options DENY, the OAuth CSP), so this

// written the append-only `audit_log` row this limiter exists to bound. It
// answers `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email` and `POST /api/auth/sign-up/email`
// (sign-up also carries a password and, with signup disabled, each POST writes
