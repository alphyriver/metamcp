/**
 * Admin CRUD over DCR-registered OAuth clients (the `oauth_clients` table).
 *
 * Before this existed, a client could only be minted by POSTing to the public
 * `/oauth/register` DCR endpoint by hand — so pairing a Claude connector meant
 * a hand-rolled curl. This is the same mint, reachable from the admin UI.
 *
 * `create` does NOT re-implement registration: it calls the same
 * `buildClientRegistration` core the DCR endpoint calls, then persists through
 * the same `oauthRepository.upsertClient`. The only thing that differs between
 * the two paths is the transport and who is allowed to use it.
 *
 * Distinct from `oauth.impl.ts`, which manages OAuth *sessions* — this
 * gateway's own outbound credentials when it connects to an upstream MCP
 * server. Different table, opposite direction of trust.
