/**
 * Admin surface over the account list — the Users section of the Access

 *
 * Self-registration abuse: an attacker's member accounts were
 * invisible, because MetaMCP has no users page and no list-users procedure.
 * Every access path (API keys, OAuth clients, endpoints) had an admin view;
 * the accounts those paths belong to did not.
 *
 * Three administrative tiers, deliberately distinct, weakest first:
 *   revokeAccess — sever live access; the account can sign straight back in
 *   setDisabled  — lock the account out; everything preserved as evidence
 *   delete       — destroy the account and everything the FK graph reaches
 * Disable is the containment primitive: it is the only one that both
 * stops the attacker and keeps the record of who they were.
 *
 * Every procedure in the matching router is `adminProcedure` — there is no
 * per-user ownership to scope an account listing by, and enumerating every
 * account in the deployment is exactly the disclosure a member must not have.
 *
 * ALL THREE TIERS EMIT (`user.disabled.set` / `user.enabled.set`,
 * `user.access.revoked`, `user.delete`), and that is not symmetry for its own
 * sake: these are the operations an administrator performs WHILE containing
 * an attack, so they are the ones an after-action review reads first. They
 * also tear their targets down with raw drizzle rather than through
 * better-auth, so no `databaseHooks` sink sees them — an emitter here is the
 * only way they are recorded at all.
 *
 * SECRETS. Between them these procedures delete sessions, OAuth access and
 * refresh tokens, authorization codes and API keys, and reset M365
 * delegations. `detail` therefore carries COUNTS and one clamped email,
 * never a credential value: `audit_log` is append-only with no prune path,
 * so a token copied into it would outlive the revocation meant to kill it.
