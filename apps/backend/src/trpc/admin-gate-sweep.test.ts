/**
 * MINOR sweep (independent security review, 2026-07-14): gate
 * tools.create/tools.sync (curation-class, same rationale as
 * namespaces.updateToolStatus — writes to the shared tools catalog),
 * logs.clear (destructive, gateway-wide), and oauth.upsert (writes upstream
 * MCP-server OAuth credentials, a server-config surface) to adminProcedure.
 * `logs.clear` has since been REMOVED outright — see its describe block
 * below, which now asserts absence.
 *
 * Pre-condition verified by code inspection: `namespaces.refreshTools`
 * (still protectedProcedure, so a non-admin owner keeps it — see
 * namespaces-curation-admin.test.ts) calls `toolsRepository.bulkUpsert`
 * directly from `apps/backend/src/trpc/namespaces.impl.ts`, never routing
 * through the `tools.create`/`tools.sync` tRPC procedures gated here.
 * Gating those two procedures therefore had no effect on the refreshTools
 * path — which is why that path needed its own gate for the PUBLIC-namespace
 * case, added in the impl and pinned by
 * `namespaces.refresh-tools.impl.test.ts`.

/**

 *
 * The gate was never the problem: the procedure only emptied the in-memory
 * ring buffer, but it was the one admin gesture that erased the live security
 * view mid-investigation, and it is the exact affordance the operator
 * requirement forbids — no application or admin path that clears the record.
 * An admin-gated wipe is still a wipe.
 *
 * Asserted against the router's procedure map rather than by calling
 * `caller.clear()`, because a caller for a missing procedure fails as a plain
 * TypeError, which is also what a typo in the test would produce.
