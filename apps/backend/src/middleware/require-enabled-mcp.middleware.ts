/**
 * `users.disabled` enforcement (migration 0027) for the ENTIRE `/mcp-proxy`
 * surface.
 *
 * Why none of the checks that shipped with Disable reach this router: each of
 * them sits on a different path. The sign-in hook in `auth.ts` only stops a
 * NEW session; the `trpc.ts` context guard only covers the tRPC surface; the
 * api-key/OAuth middleware only covers the endpoint data plane. `/mcp-proxy`
 * is plain express routing behind a raw better-auth session cookie and
 * touches none of them, and `requireAdminMcpMiddleware` next to it tests
 * `role` and nothing else. Sessions live 30 days in this fork
 * (BETTER_AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRES_IN_SECONDS), so a DISABLED ADMIN kept
 * `/mcp-proxy/server/stdio` — which hands a command to `spawn()` with the
 * backend's environment (see `require-admin-mcp.middleware.ts` for the full
 * chain, including why that command is now sourced from the `mcp_servers` row
 * instead of the query string) — for the remaining life of a cookie they
 * already held. That is process execution on the gateway host outliving the
 * button whose entire purpose is to end an account's access.
 *
 * Mounted at the parent router (`routers/mcp-proxy.ts`) between authentication
 * and the role gate, so it covers both sub-routers and anything mounted under
 * them later. Before the role gate rather than after: the allowed set is the
 * same either way (admin AND enabled), but this ordering means the lockout
 * does not depend on the role gate staying admin-only — if `/mcp-proxy` is
 * ever opened to another role, a disabled account is still refused. Account
 * validity belongs with authentication; role belongs with authorization.
 *
 * Fail-closed on every branch:
 *  - no resolvable user id on the request denies, rather than querying with
 *    `undefined`,
 *  - `usersRepository.isDisabled` returns `true` for an id with no row,
 *  - a lookup that throws is caught HERE and denied. It must not propagate:
 *    an async express middleware that rejects hands nothing to `next(err)`,
 *    so the request would hang until the client gave up instead of being
 *    refused — and a hang on a spawn-capable route is not a safe failure.
 *
 * Second consumer, so "the ENTIRE `/mcp-proxy` surface" above is now where
 * this gate started rather than everywhere it runs: the two operator routes
 * in `routers/public-metamcp/admin.ts` (`reset-errors`, `error-status`) apply
 * it per route, in the same position — after authentication, before the role
 * gate — for the same reason.
