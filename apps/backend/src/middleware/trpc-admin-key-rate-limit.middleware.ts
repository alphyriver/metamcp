/**
 * A failure-only 429 gate for the admin-plane (control-plane) bearer path on
 * `/trpc` (migration 0038). Mounted AFTER trpcRateLimitMiddleware, so the
 * 600/min/IP request cap still bounds total volume ahead of it and a 429 here
 * carries the CORS headers the browser needs to surface it.
 *
 * This middleware only CHECKS; the RECORD (one count per failed verification)
 * lives in lib/admin-plane-auth when a bearer fails to resolve. Split check and
 * record so a request costs exactly one count, the pattern lib/auth-rate-limiter
 * documents at length.
 *
 * COOKIE PRECEDENCE: a request carrying a session cookie is
 * skipped entirely, so a stale Authorization header on a cookie-authenticated
 * user can never draw a 429. createContext resolves the cookie first and never
 * reaches the bearer path for such a request, so it also never RECORDS a failure
 *, the two halves agree. The residual is deliberate: a caller can attach a junk
 * cookie to skip this CHECK, but its bearer attempt is still recorded and
 * audited, and an admin-plane key is sk_mt_ + 64 chars of nanoid entropy, not
 * something a rate limiter is what stands between it and a guess (threat case 1:
 * the control is revocation and detection, not brute-force resistance). The
 * limiter's job is to keep FAILED verifications from amplifying audit writes,
 * which the record-on-failure half still does regardless of the cookie.
