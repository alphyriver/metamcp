/**
 * Admin-only gate for the ENTIRE `/mcp-proxy` surface.
 *
 * Why the whole surface, not just one route: `/mcp-proxy/*` is the MCP
 * Inspector, an operator dev tool that proxies a browser session straight at
 * an MCP transport. Its STDIO branch hands a command to `spawn()` with the
 * backend's full `process.env` (`routers/mcp-proxy/server.ts`
 * `createTransport` -> `ProcessManagedStdioTransport.start`), so being able to
 * reach this router at all starts processes on the gateway host as the gateway
 * user. That command used to be read from the QUERY STRING, which made it
 * arbitrary command execution; it now comes from the `mcp_servers` row only
 * (`findRegisteredStdioServer`), so what is reachable here is "start any
 * REGISTERED server" rather than "run anything". This gate is still what
 * decides who may do that, and it is not the sourcing fix's backstop nor the
 * other way round. Until this gate the only check was
 * `betterAuthMcpMiddleware`, which
 * proves a valid session and nothing else — every member-role account could
 * run commands on the gateway. Gating route-by-route would leave the next
 * route added to this router unprotected, so the gate sits at the parent
 * router (`routers/mcp-proxy.ts`) and covers stdio, sse, message, mcp
 * GET/POST/DELETE, health, and every future addition.
 *
 * Why `req.user.role` is trustworthy here: `betterAuthMcpMiddleware` sets
 * `req.user` from better-auth's `GET /api/auth/get-session`, and `role`
 * rides along as a better-auth `additionalFields` entry declared with
 * `input: false` (`src/auth.ts`), so no client can supply it on sign-up or
 * user-update — it comes from the DB column default plus deliberate admin
 * action. No `cookieCache` is configured on the session, so get-session
 * re-reads the user row per request and a demotion takes effect at once.
 * This is the same field, from the same call, that `adminProcedure`
 * (`packages/trpc/src/trpc.ts` `requireAdmin`) already gates the product's
 * administrative tRPC surface on.
 *
 * Fail-closed by construction: the test is positive (`role === "admin"`
 * passes), so a missing user, a missing role, an unknown role, or any future
 * change to the session payload shape all land on 403 rather than on access.
 *
 * Second consumer, so "the ENTIRE `/mcp-proxy` surface" above is now where
 * this gate started rather than everywhere it runs: the two operator routes
 * in `routers/public-metamcp/admin.ts` (`reset-errors`, `error-status`) apply
 * it per route, because their router shares a mount with the API-key data
 * plane that must never be asked for a session cookie.

 * are 403 with this exact body, so a caller cannot tell "not an admin" from
 * "an admin who has been locked out". The distinguishing detail is logged at
 * each gate, where the operator reads it and the caller does not — the same
 * rule the OAuth token planes follow. Sharing one builder rather than
 * copying the literal is what keeps the two indistinguishable through later
 * edits.
 *
 * A function rather than a shared constant, for the reason
 * `lib/health-upstream.ts` `buildUpstreamHealthErrorBody` gives: express
 * serialises the returned object directly, and a single shared instance is
 * an invitation for a later mutation to rewrite an earlier response.
