/**
 * The gateway's terminal error handler.
 *
 * Found by a security review: a
 * POST of malformed JSON to any non-proxy route —
 * `curl -X POST .../trpc/x -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '{bad'`
 * — came back with a full stack trace. `express.json()` rejects the body
 * BEFORE tRPC is ever reached, so neither tRPC errorFormatter (the one in
 * `packages/trpc/src/trpc.ts` or the backend's own) was on that path, and
 * nothing else was: the response was written by Express's built-in final
 * handler, which serialises `err.stack` whenever NODE_ENV is not
 * "production". The production `Dockerfile` and the two root compose files
 * set no NODE_ENV of their own (`.devcontainer/Dockerfile` does, to
 * `development`), though both compose files pass the whole `.env` in through
 * `env_file:` and `example.env` ships `NODE_ENV=production` on its first
 * line, so that branch is live on any deployment whose `.env` lacks the
 * line and dead on one that kept it. Where it was live, what an
 * unauthenticated caller got was absolute `/app/...` container paths, the
 * pnpm store layout with exact dependency names AND versions
 * (`body-parser`, `raw-body`, …) and node internals: a free dependency
 * inventory to match against advisories, from one request with no
 * credentials. This handler does not read the variable at all, so the same
 * response goes out either way.
 *
 * Two failure classes, two constant bodies, no error text ever echoed:
 *
 *  - 4xx (the caller's fault): the STATUS is passed through so a client can
 *    still tell "your JSON is broken" (400) from "your body is too big"
 *    (413), but the BODY is the same two keys either way. A status code
 *    carries no internals; a message can, and body-parser's messages quote
 *    the offending input back.
 *  - anything else: a fixed 500. The full error goes to the server log,
 *    where the operator who needs the stack can read it, and nowhere else.
 *
 * Registered LAST in `index.ts`, after every route mount, because Express
 * dispatches error middleware in registration order — one registered before
 * a router never sees that router's errors.
