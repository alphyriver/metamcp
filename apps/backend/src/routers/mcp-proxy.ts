// Authentication, then account validity, then authorization for the WHOLE
// proxy surface. All three live here at the parent router rather than inside
// each sub-router so no route file can ever be mounted under /mcp-proxy
// without them — the sub-routers used to apply the session check themselves,
// which left the gate one forgotten `use()` away from a hole. Order is
// load-bearing: betterAuthMcpMiddleware populates `req.user` from the session
// cookie, requireEnabledMcpMiddleware then re-reads `users.disabled` for that
// id, and requireAdminMcpMiddleware reads `req.user.role`. The admin
// restriction is not accidental hardening — the STDIO branch of
// /server/{stdio,sse,mcp} spawns a process with the backend's environment, so
// session-only access was remote code execution for any member back when the
// command came off the query string. It now comes from the `mcp_servers` row
// only (see mcp-proxy/server.ts findRegisteredStdioServer), which makes these
// two layers independent: the gate decides WHO may start a server, the
// resolver decides WHICH servers exist to be started, and neither is the
// other's backstop. See middleware/require-admin-mcp.middleware.ts.
//
// The disabled gate sits between the two because a valid cookie is not a
// valid ACCOUNT: nothing else on this router re-reads `users.disabled`, so
// without it an admin who was locked out mid-session kept that same spawn
// route for the 30-day life of the cookie they already held. See
// middleware/require-enabled-mcp.middleware.ts.
