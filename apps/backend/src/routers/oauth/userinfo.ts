/**
 * Record the destruction of an expired access token, before it is destroyed.
 *
 * The branch below DELETES a real, currently-stored token row and answers 401.
 * Until this emitter existed it wrote nothing anywhere — no audit row, no log
 * line — so the credential and every trace of when it had been minted vanished
 * in the same request. This is the same defect, and the same fix, as the
 * expired-code / expired-refresh / expired-introspect branches in ./token.ts,
 * whose `emitTokenLifecycle` header carries the full emit/no-emit doctrine.
 *
 * IT IS EMITTED FOR THE SAME REASON THEY ARE, which is not severity but replay
 * amplification: `audit_log` has no prune path, so a branch an anonymous caller
 * can reach with an invented string must never write to it. This branch cannot
 * be reached with an invented string — it requires a token this server issued
 * and still holds — and reaching it deletes that token, so a replay finds
 * nothing and writes nothing. One row per credential destroyed.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL, STATED HERE BECAUSE THIS ENDPOINT CARRIES THE MOST OF IT: that
 * is one row per destroy ATTEMPT. Read-then-delete is not atomic and
 * `deleteAccessToken` returns void rather than a row count, so N concurrent
 * presentations of the SAME expired token each read the row before the first
 * delete commits and each write a row. /oauth/userinfo also has NO rate
 * limiter — ./index.ts mounts it behind CORS, security headers and the body
 * parsers only, while `rateLimitToken` guards /oauth/token and the failure
 * limiter plus the RFC 7662 credential gate guard /oauth/introspect — so it is
 * the branch a burst actually reaches. Kept anyway, because the alternative is
 * to emit AFTER a delete that reports what it removed, which loses the record
 * in precisely the failed-delete case this ordering exists for. One burst per
 * real credential, once, against zero rows before this emitter existed.
 * ./token.ts's `emitTokenLifecycle` header states the same trade for the other
 * three branches.
 *
 * `oauth.token.userinfo` rather than `oauth.userinfo`: the subject of the event
 * is the token, and this endpoint is the second half of the same token-metadata
 * plane as `oauth.token.introspect`. Keeping the prefix keeps one credential's
 * whole life queryable with `action LIKE 'oauth.token.%'`.
 *
 * The token is recorded ONLY as a sha256 + last-4 fingerprint, matching every
 * other emitter on this plane, so it stays joinable to the `oauth.token.issue`
 * row that minted it without the append-only table ever holding the credential.
