 * The failure-only rate-limit key for GET /oauth/userinfo, keyed on the edge

 *
 * Keyed on resolveClientIp (Cloudflare's per-caller CF-Connecting-IP) with
 * req.ip as the fallback, the same keying rateLimitAuth and rateLimitToken use.
 * `trust proxy` is deliberately off (see audit-context.middleware), so req.ip
 * behind the tunnel is one container-local address shared by every caller.
 * Keying on it alone would make this a single global bucket, and because the
 * gate below runs before the token is even looked up, one source spraying
 * failed lookups would then 429 userinfo for every caller behind the tunnel,
 * including one holding a real token. This endpoint had no limiter at all
 * before, so that would be a brand-new whole-deployment outage caused by the
 * control meant to prevent one. Per-edge-IP keying bounds the failing source
 * instead; the req.ip fallback degrades to the old shared bucket only for
 * direct-to-origin and local development.
 *
 * The /oauth/introspect and /oauth/revoke siblings still share
 * getPublicOAuthRateLimitIdentifier's per-container bucket; unifying all three
 * on this keying is a follow-up, kept out of this change because those two are
 * not otherwise touched here.
 *
 * Namespaced `oauth-public:userinfo:` so spam here cannot spend the endpoint
 * data plane's budget, and per route so it cannot spend introspect's or
 * revoke's either.

/**
 * Record the destruction of an expired access token, before it is destroyed.
 *
 * The branch below DELETES a real, currently-stored token row and answers 401.
 * Until this emitter existed it wrote nothing anywhere — no audit row, no log
 * line — so the credential and every trace of when it had been minted vanished
 * in the same request. This is the same defect, and the same fix, as the
 * expired-code / expired-refresh / expired-introspect branches in ./token.ts,
 * whose `emitTokenLifecycle` header carries the full emit/no-emit doctrine.
 *
 * IT IS EMITTED FOR THE SAME REASON THEY ARE, which is not severity but replay
 * amplification: `audit_log` has no prune path, so a branch an anonymous caller
 * can reach with an invented string must never write to it. This branch cannot
 * be reached with an invented string — it requires a token this server issued
 * and still holds — and reaching it deletes that token, so a replay finds
 * nothing and writes nothing. One row per credential destroyed.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL, STATED HERE BECAUSE THIS ENDPOINT CARRIES THE MOST OF IT: that
 * is one row per destroy ATTEMPT. Read-then-delete is not atomic and
 * `deleteAccessToken` returns void rather than a row count, so N concurrent
 * presentations of the SAME expired token each read the row before the first
 * delete commits and each write a row. /oauth/userinfo now carries the same
 * failure-only limiter as /oauth/introspect and /oauth/revoke (the expired
 * branch below records a failure), so a burst of the same expired token is
 * bounded at roughly one window's budget per edge IP rather than unbounded —
 * where before it had no limiter at all. Emit-first is kept anyway, because the
 * alternative is to emit AFTER a delete that reports what it removed, which
 * loses the record in precisely the failed-delete case this ordering exists
 * for. ./token.ts's `emitTokenLifecycle` header states the same trade for the
 * other three branches.
 *
 * `oauth.token.userinfo` rather than `oauth.userinfo`: the subject of the event
 * is the token, and this endpoint is the second half of the same token-metadata
 * plane as `oauth.token.introspect`. Keeping the prefix keeps one credential's
 * whole life queryable with `action LIKE 'oauth.token.%'`.
 *
 * The token is recorded ONLY as a sha256 + last-4 fingerprint, matching every
 * other emitter on this plane, so it stays joinable to the `oauth.token.issue`
 * row that minted it without the append-only table ever holding the credential.
