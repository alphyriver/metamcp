/**
 * Signed authorization-request ("areq") tokens for the OAuth consent screen.
 *
 * The consent screen splits what used to be one request into three: the browser
 * asks `/oauth/authorize` for authorization, a human approves on a page, and
 * `/oauth/authorize/decision` mints the code. The authorization parameters have
 * to survive that round trip through the user's browser, and the previous
 * version of this flow carried them as a plain base64 blob — which meant a
 * caller could edit client_id, redirect_uri or the PKCE challenge in flight and
 * hand the edited blob back. Everything the decision endpoint trusts therefore
 * travels HMAC-signed and short-lived, and is re-validated against the client
 * record on the way out anyway.
 *
 * The `csrf` nonce in the payload is the server's half of a double-submit pair:
 * the same value is written to an httpOnly cookie when the token is issued, so
 * approving requires possession of BOTH the token (in the URL of a page only
 * the signed-in user was redirected to) and the cookie (which SameSite=Lax
 * keeps off cross-site POSTs, and which httpOnly keeps out of reach of script).
