/**
 * Rate limiting middleware for the RFC 7591 dynamic-registration endpoint.
 *
 * WHY /oauth/register HAS ITS OWN LIMITER INSTANCE, separate from
 * /oauth/token's. It once shared `rateLimitToken`, and that was a
 * denial-of-service against pairing rather than a control on it: 20 anonymous
 * registrations in a minute spent the same bucket that legitimate claude.ai
 * token exchanges needed, so the connector's exchange came back 429. The
 * endpoint an attacker can reach for free must not be able to close the
 * endpoint a paired client depends on. A separate limiter instance keeps the
 * two budgets independent even now that all three key the same way.
 *
 * KEYED ON CF-Connecting-IP, with `req.ip` as the fallback — the same keying
 * rateLimitAuth and rateLimitToken now use. Cloudflare overwrites that header
 * at the edge on every request, so it is per-CALLER instead of per-container.
 * The trust assumption is exactly the one audit-context.middleware documents at
 * length: it holds only while the Cloudflare Tunnel is the sole ingress.
 * `req.ip` remains the fallback for direct-to-origin and local development,
 * where it degrades to a single shared bucket.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL, PLAINLY: per-IP keying means the ceiling is per source
 * address, not global, so a distributed caller is not bounded by this at all.
 * That is deliberate. What bounds the damage of registration flooding is the
 * pair of changes it ships with — the input caps in ./client-registration.ts
 * (how big a row can be) and the retention sweep in ./client-retention.ts (how
 * long a never-used row survives) — and unlike a global ceiling, neither of
 * them can refuse a real connector trying to pair.
