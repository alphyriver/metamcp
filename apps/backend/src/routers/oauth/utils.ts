/**
 * Rate limiting middleware for the RFC 7591 dynamic-registration endpoint.
 *
 * WHY /oauth/register CANNOT SHARE /oauth/token's BUCKET. It did, and that was
 * a denial-of-service against pairing rather than a control on it: both routes
 * carried `rateLimitToken`, which keys on `req.ip`, and `trust proxy` is
 * deliberately off (see audit-context.middleware), so every caller through the
 * tunnel lands in ONE bucket. 20 anonymous registrations in a minute therefore
 * spent the budget that legitimate claude.ai token exchanges needed, and the
 * connector's exchange came back 429. The endpoint an attacker can reach for
 * free must not be able to close the endpoint a paired client depends on.
 *
 * KEYED ON CF-Connecting-IP, not `req.ip`. Cloudflare overwrites that header at
 * the edge on every request, so it is per-CALLER instead of per-container, and
 * this limiter finally bounds what it is named for. The trust assumption is
 * exactly the one audit-context.middleware documents at length: it holds only
 * while the Cloudflare Tunnel is the sole ingress. `req.ip` remains the
 * fallback for direct-to-origin and local development, where it degrades to
 * the single shared bucket this endpoint had before.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL, PLAINLY: per-IP keying means the ceiling is per source
 * address, not global, so a distributed caller is not bounded by this at all.
 * That is deliberate. What bounds the damage of registration flooding is the
 * pair of changes it ships with — the input caps in ./client-registration.ts
 * (how big a row can be) and the retention sweep in ./client-retention.ts (how
 * long a never-used row survives) — and unlike a global ceiling, neither of
