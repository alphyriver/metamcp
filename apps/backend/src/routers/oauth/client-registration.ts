/**
 * Shared OAuth 2.1 client-registration core.
 *
 * Lifted out of the RFC 7591 dynamic-registration express handler when the
 * admin UI gained a "create OAuth client" flow, so both mint paths run ONE
 * set of rules. Two entry points each carrying their own copy would drift,
 * and the drift would be silent in the dangerous direction: a UI-minted
 * client that skipped `isAllowedRedirectUri` is an open redirect, and one that
 * skipped the auth-method check could be stored with a method the token
 * endpoint refuses to honour.
 *
 * That sharing also means the redirect_uri host allowlist covers the admin UI's
 * create-client dialog, not just anonymous DCR. Deliberate: an admin who needs
 * a callback host outside `DCR_REDIRECT_URI_ALLOWED_HOSTS` changes that env
 * var, which leaves a deployment-visible record of the decision, rather than
 * quietly minting through the UI a client the anonymous path would refuse.
 *
 * Deliberately free of express and of the database — it takes an untrusted
 * object and returns either a row ready to persist or an RFC 7591 error pair.
 * Callers own the transport (`registration.ts` maps the error to a 400 JSON
 * body, the tRPC impl maps it to a BAD_REQUEST) and own the write. That keeps
 * it directly unit-testable without standing up a server or a DB, the same
 * shape `requireAdmin` uses for the RBAC gate.
 *
 * It lives beside `utils.ts` rather than under `lib/` because the credential
 * generators and the redirect-URI validator it composes live here; nothing in
 * `lib/` currently imports from `routers/`, and inverting that layering for
 * three helpers would be a bigger change than this feature warrants.

 * into `oauth_clients`, a table with cascade children and, until the retention
 * sweep in ./index.ts, no prune path whatsoever. Nothing capped the input, so
 * one anonymous request could store a multi-megabyte `redirect_uris` array,
 * and 45 never-used client rows had already accumulated from junk
 * registrations. Validating the SHAPE of a redirect URI while leaving its
 * LENGTH unbounded is what turned an audit table into a disk-exhaustion
 * primitive.
 *
 * WHY THESE NUMBERS. They are the smallest values that no real client comes
 * near. A connector registers one or two callbacks (claude.ai's is under 50
 * characters); ten at 512 is an order of magnitude of headroom on both axes.
 * MAX_CLIENT_NAME_LENGTH is 255 to match the `.max(255)` the admin UI's
 * CreateOAuthClientRequestSchema already enforces in @repo/zod-types — the two
 * mint paths share this core precisely so a rule cannot differ between them.
 *
 * Over-cap input is refused with the RFC 7591 error pair this endpoint already
 * emits (`invalid_redirect_uri` for the callback list, `invalid_request` for
 * everything else). No new error code: a registered client would not recognise
 * one, and the caps are a size rule, not a new failure mode.
