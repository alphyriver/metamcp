/**
 * Retention sweep for dynamically-registered OAuth clients that were never
 * used.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NEEDED. `POST /oauth/register` is anonymous by RFC 7591 design,
 * so `oauth_clients` is a table an unauthenticated caller can INSERT into and
 * nothing could ever DELETE from except an administrator clicking through the
 * admin UI one row at a time. 45 junk rows had accumulated that way. The input
 * caps in ./client-registration.ts bound how BIG each row can be; this bounds
 * how MANY there are.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS "DYNAMICALLY REGISTERED", which is the first condition and
 * the one that is not obvious. `oauth_clients` has TWO mint paths — this
 * endpoint, and the admin UI's create-client dialog — and they are
 * indistinguishable by client_id, because both go through the same
 * `buildClientRegistration` core and therefore the same
 * `generateSecureClientId()`. Every row from either door reads
 * `mcp_client_<random>`. So the sweep matches on `registration_source`, the
 * column migration 0029 added for exactly this: the DCR endpoint stamps
 * `'dcr'`, the admin path stamps `'admin'`, and only `'dcr'` is ever deleted.
 *
 * That distinction is load-bearing rather than tidy. An admin-minted client
 * with no tokens is the NORMAL state of a partner integration that has been
 * pre-provisioned and not yet paired — the credentials are sitting in an email
 * waiting for someone on the other end — so "never used" means something
 * completely different on that path than it does on the anonymous one.
 *
 * Rows predating 0029 carry NULL and are never swept: their provenance was not
 * recorded and cannot be reconstructed, so they are treated as possibly-admin.
 * That leaves the original junk backlog in place, deletable from the admin UI;
 * the sweep exists to bound what an anonymous caller can add from now on, and
 * a fixed finite set of old rows is not that problem.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS "NEVER USED", and why that is a safe test on this deployment.
 * A client is swept only when it has zero authorization codes AND zero access
 * tokens AND was created longer ago than the retention window. The second
 * condition is what makes this safe: `oauthRepository.cleanupExpired` deletes
 * an access-token row only once the access token AND the refresh token are
 * both expired, and the fork's default refresh TTL is 365 days
 * (OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS in ./token.ts). So a client that has ever
 * completed one token exchange keeps a row for about a year of total
 * inactivity, while a client that registered and never came back has neither
 * child row from the moment it was written. A real connector pairing runs DCR
 * and authorize seconds apart, never days.
 *
 * THE COUPLING TO STATE OUT LOUD, because it is the thing that would make this
 * sweep wrong: it depends on the refresh-token TTL being much longer than this
 * window. Lower OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS below
 * DCR_CLIENT_RETENTION_DAYS and a paired-but-dormant client can lose its row
 * and have to register again. Anyone shortening that TTL must revisit this
 * number.
