/**
 * The `/api/auth` relay: an Express request in, a better-auth `Response` out.
 *
 * Lives in its own module rather than inline in ../index because ../index
 * cannot be imported — it calls `app.listen()` and initialises the pool at
 * module scope. The two rules this relay has to hold (no CORS grant copied out
 * of better-auth, no error detail copied out to the caller) are security
 * behaviour, and behaviour that cannot be imported cannot be tested; see
 * `auth-relay.test.ts`.
 *
 * Mounted directly after `authApiCorsMiddleware` in ../index, which owns the
 * CORS policy for these paths.
