/**
 * Destination validation for the mcp-proxy's REMOTE-URL transports (SSE and
 * STREAMABLE_HTTP).
 *
 * Those two branches take `url` off the request query and have the backend
 * open a connection to it, forwarding the caller's `Authorization` header and
 * the matched server row's stored headers. The route is admin-gated, but the
 * gate is a session cookie, and a `SameSite=Lax` cookie rides along on a
 * top-level GET — so any page an admin visits can name a destination and the
 * backend will connect to it from INSIDE the network, with whatever the
 * backend's own network position reaches. That is the whole vulnerability
 * class: server-side request forgery, blind but sufficient, with cloud
 * instance-metadata sitting at a fixed link-local address behind it.
 *
 * The fix is a destination check, not a registry check: the operator's
 * "point the Inspector at a new server and see if it works" flow has to keep
 * working, so this refuses by ADDRESS RANGE rather than by "is this row
 * already in the database". A URL whose host resolves anywhere on the public
 * internet still connects exactly as before.
 *
 * Two layers, because one is not enough:
 *  - `assertPublicMcpUrl` runs before the transport is constructed, so a
 *    hostile URL is refused before anything is opened.
 *  - `createGuardedFetch` re-runs the same check on EVERY request the
 *    transport makes, including redirect hops and — for SSE — the POST
 *    endpoint the remote server itself advertises in its `endpoint` event,
 *    which is remote-controlled input that never passes through the route
 *    handler at all.
 */

/**
 * One refusal string for every way a destination can fail this check.
 *
 * Deliberately says nothing about WHICH rule refused and never echoes the
 * caller's URL. A caller who can tell "blocked because private" from "blocked
 * because it did not resolve" has a network-mapping oracle: the difference
 * between those two answers is exactly the information a blind SSRF is trying
 * to recover. The specific reason goes to the log, where an operator
 * debugging their own misconfiguration can read it.
