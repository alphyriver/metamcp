/**
 * Idle-TTL sweeper for public-endpoint (API-key / OAuth) StreamableHTTP
 * sessions.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (the pool-cap outage):
 * A public endpoint session is created per API-key request stream and is
 * only torn down when the client sends an explicit `DELETE`. Most clients
 * never send it, so under sustained load public sessions accumulate
 * indefinitely. Each holds backend pool connections; once the global
 * backend pool reaches `MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS` every new connect
 * LRU-evicts a LIVE connection, surfacing as transient
 * "Failed to re-initialize session ... after backend session loss"
 * tool failures. Persistent sessions (`sessionLifetime` null, the prod
 * default) never expire by design, so the existing age-based
 * `SessionLifetimeManagerImpl` cleanup timer never fires.
 *
 * This sweeper reaps on a DIFFERENT axis than that age-based timer:
 * last-request IDLE time, not session CREATION age. A reaped session's
 * consumer reconnects transparently on its next request via the fork's
 * lazy session-recovery path (`recoverPersistedSession` in
 * `streamable-http.ts`) — which requires the `mcp_sessions` ROW to still
 * exist. `reapSession` (injected by the caller) MUST be a row-preserving
 * teardown variant (close transport, drop in-memory session state,
 * release pool connections — skip the DB row delete), not the same
 * variant a client `DELETE` uses. Foreman review (PR #72 fixes round)
 * caught an earlier version of this PR wired to the row-DELETING variant,
 * which made a reaped session's next request 404 instead of lazily
 * recovering — harmless for spec-conformant clients (they just
 * re-`initialize`), but the Anthropic/claude.ai connector wraps that 404
 * as `-32600 "Anthropic Proxy: Invalid content from server"` and stays
 * broken until a manual `/mcp reconnect`, exactly the failure mode PR
 * #22/#23's capability-hash refusal narrowing exists to avoid. See
 * `streamable-http.ts`'s `reapIdleSession` for the row-preserving variant
 * and its accepted-tradeoff note (reaped rows linger until the
 * `MCP_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` pruner catches them).
 *
 * Conventions mirror the PR #70 tool-definition sweep in
 * `mcp-server-pool.ts`: env-tunable interval, a single-in-flight
 * re-entrancy guard, cleanup on dispose, and WARN/INFO discipline (one
 * INFO line only when a sweep actually reaps something, debug otherwise).
 *
 * Known blind spot (NARROWED by the SDK 1.30.0 bump, not proven closed): a
 * half-open TCP connection — client process died or a network path
 * silently dropped packets without FIN/RST — keeps an open standalone GET
 * stream's `dispatchTracked` call pending indefinitely from Node's
 * perspective, so the in-flight guard below never releases and the session
 * is never reaped even though no real client is listening. SDK 1.30.0's
 * default 15s SSE keep-alive frames now push bytes at that dead peer, so
 * the kernel's retransmit timeout eventually errors the socket and settles
 * the dispatch — on the kernel's clock, not ours, and inferred from the
 * SDK source rather than runtime-verified. See the comment on
 * `dispatchTracked` in `streamable-http.ts` for the full writeup and the
 * residual follow-up (SO_KEEPALIVE / a fork-side missed-heartbeat
 * threshold).
