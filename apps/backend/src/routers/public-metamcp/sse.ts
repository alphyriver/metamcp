 * consumer's stream.
 *
 * A missing session and a session owned by someone else both resolve to
 * `not_found` so the route's 404 never signals the id is live elsewhere.
 * `refusedReason` exists ONLY to drive the server-side warn log and audit row,
 * never the response shape: it is non-null exactly when a session WAS resident
 * and was refused, and null for a genuine miss. One field rather than a
 * separate boolean plus a reason, so the fact of a refusal and its recorded
 * cause cannot disagree.
 *
 * The resolver stays PURE — it emits nothing. The route below owns the audit
 * row, because that is where the authenticated request lives; keeping the
 * emission out of here is what lets `sse.test.ts` drive the guard against a
 * seeded manager with no express harness and no postgres.
