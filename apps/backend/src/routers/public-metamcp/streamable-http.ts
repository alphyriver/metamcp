 *
 *   - `deleteRow: true` (client DELETE, the age-based `sessionLifetime`

 *
 *   - `deleteRow: false` (idle-TTL sweep reap) — the ROW MUST SURVIVE.
 *     An earlier version of this sweeper reaped via the row-deleting
 *     variant, which made a reaped session's next request 404 instead of
 *     lazily recovering. Spec-conformant SDK clients handle that cleanly
 *     (they just re-`initialize`), but the Anthropic/claude.ai connector

 *     exact failure mode PR #22/#23's capability-hash refusal narrowing
 *     exists to avoid (see `recoverPersistedSession` above). Preserving
 *     the row lets `recoverPersistedSession` rebuild the transport
 *     transparently on the consumer's next request. Accepted tradeoff:
 *     reaped rows linger in `mcp_sessions` until the age-based
 *     `MCP_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` pruner (`runMcpSessionPrune`, default 7
 *     days) catches them — rows are tiny (session_id / namespace /
 *     endpoint / a principal hash, no session state), so that lingering
 *     window is a storage non-issue, not a security concern (the
 *     principal hash still gates recovery). A dedicated shorter purge for
 *     specifically sweep-reaped rows is a named follow-up, not this PR.
