 * authenticated for endpoint B, or, on any endpoint reachable by more than one
 * credential, consumer A's live session to consumer B. `/health/sessions` used

 * the credential must be the one the session was opened with. The in-memory
 * fast path — which serves every request after the first — checked only the

 *
 * THREE outcomes, and the split between the last two is the load-bearing part:
 *
 *  - `ok` — serve it.
 *  - `absent` — nothing resident under this id. The caller falls through to
 *    lazy recovery, which may legitimately rebuild the session from
 *    `mcp_sessions`.
 *  - `refused` — a session IS resident but is not this caller's. The caller
 *    answers 404 DIRECTLY and never attempts recovery. Falling through would
 *    reach `recoverPersistedSession`, whose principal check fails and returns
 *    `auth_failed` -> 401, which both breaks the spec's re-initialize contract
 *    (a client is told to fix its credential, not to start a new session) and
 *    tells the caller that the id it presented is real and belongs to someone
 *    else. The route funnels `refused` into the same 404 statement as a
 *    genuine miss, so the response CONTENT cannot distinguish them.
 *
 * Content, not timing: `refused` returns from memory while a genuine miss
 * spends a `mcpSessionsRepository.findById` round trip, so the two remain
 * separable by latency. That is left open on purpose — closing it would mean
 * burning a pointless query on every refusal, and the oracle it leaves is
 * worth nothing against `randomUUID` session ids, which an attacker has to

 * that needs nothing but a session id.
 *
 * Checks the in-memory binding first through `boundSessionMatches` (endpoint +
 * creating identity). If the session isn't resident, the persisted row is the
 * only evidence, so the check is the one that row can support: the endpoint
 * pair via `bindingMatches`, plus the same `auth_method` + `auth_principal`
 * comparison `recoverPersistedSession` makes. Verifying the endpoint alone
 * there would leave the hole open for exactly the sessions the idle sweeper
 * has already reaped, whose rows survive by design.
 *
 * A lookup failure is treated as absent — fail-closed, never delete on unknown
 * state. Every non-deletable case collapses into the ONE `not_found` outcome,
 * so the route's single 404 response cannot reveal that the id is live and
 * owned by someone else.
 *
 * THE TWO BRANCHES DEFINE "SAME PRINCIPAL" DIFFERENTLY, and that asymmetry is
 * accepted rather than accidental. In memory an OAuth session is bound to the
 * USER id, so a connector that refreshed its 24h access token still owns its
 * session. The persisted row cannot offer that: `mcp_sessions` stores only
 * `auth_principal` (a one-way hash of the token) and `auth_method` — there is
 * no user column to compare, and a user id is not recoverable from a SHA-256
 * digest. So a rotated OAuth token cannot tear down its own session once the
 * idle sweeper has reaped it: the DELETE answers 404 and the row survives to
 * the `MCP_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` pruner. That is the same rule
 * `recoverPersistedSession` has always applied — token rotation invalidates
 * the recovery path, by design, so a revoked token cannot survive a restart —
 * and the cost here is a lingering row plus a 404 on a teardown, never a live
 * session left reachable by the wrong caller. Widening it would mean storing
 * the user id alongside the hash, which is a schema change and a new thing to
 * keep in sync, for a case whose worst outcome is one row aging out.

 *
 * Known blind spot (NARROWED by the SDK 1.30.0 bump, not proven closed):
 * the GET handler below uses this same wrapper to serve a standalone SSE
 * stream (a client opens a long-lived GET with no body to receive
 * server-initiated notifications per the MCP Streamable HTTP spec).
 * `handleRequestWithUserContext`'s promise doesn't resolve until that
 * stream closes, so `markInFlight` is called once at stream-open and
 * `markSettled` only fires when the stream ends — for as long as the
 * promise is pending, the sweeper's in-flight guard correctly treats the
 * session as live. If the CLIENT dies without a clean TCP close (process
 * killed, network path silently drops packets — no FIN/RST reaches this
 * process), Node cannot know the peer is gone without OS-level keepalive
 * probing or an app-level heartbeat.
 *
 * SDK 1.30.0 ships the app-level half: `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`
 * arms an unref'd interval per SSE stream that writes a `: keepalive`
 * comment frame every `keepAliveMs` (public transport option, DEFAULT
 * 15000; values < 1 disable it). We inherit that default at every
 * construction site — see `sdk-sse-keepalive.test.ts` for the tripwire
 * that fails if a later SDK bump changes or drops it. Because those writes
 * push bytes at a peer that is gone, the kernel's retransmit timer
 * eventually errors the socket, which cancels the stream, settles the
 * pending dispatch, and lets the sweeper reap.
 *
 * Why "narrowed" and not "fixed": that chain is inferred from the SDK
 * source, NOT runtime-verified against a real half-open connection, and it
 * only fires on the kernel retransmit timescale (`tcp_retries2`, order of
 * 15 minutes) rather than on a heartbeat-miss threshold. A write that
 * merely buffers in the stream's internal queue without reaching the
 * socket would still surface nothing. Residual follow-up (not this PR):
 * `SO_KEEPALIVE` on the underlying socket, or a fork-side missed-heartbeat
 * threshold that force-settles the dispatch on our own clock instead of
 * the kernel's.

/**
 * Shared teardown for a StreamableHTTP session: close the transport, drop
 * it from `sessionManager` + the idle-TTL sweeper's tracking, and release
 * its MetaMCP/backend pool connections. `deleteRow` controls whether the
 * persisted `mcp_sessions` row is ALSO dropped — this is the one axis on
 * which the two public wrappers below (`cleanupSession`, `reapIdleSession`)
 * differ, and the distinction is load-bearing (code review, PR #72
 * fixes round):
 *
 *   - `deleteRow: true` (client DELETE, the age-based `sessionLifetime`
 *     cleanup timer) — the session is explicitly over. A later reuse of
 *     the same sessionId must NOT lazy-recover, so the row goes too.
 *
 *   - `deleteRow: false` (idle-TTL sweep reap) — the ROW MUST SURVIVE.
 *     An earlier version of this sweeper reaped via the row-deleting
 *     variant, which made a reaped session's next request 404 instead of
 *     lazily recovering. Spec-conformant SDK clients handle that cleanly
 *     (they just re-`initialize`), but the Anthropic/claude.ai connector
 *     wraps the 404 as `-32600 "Anthropic Proxy: Invalid content from
 *     server"` and stays broken until a manual `/mcp reconnect` — the
 *     exact failure mode PR #22/#23's capability-hash refusal narrowing
 *     exists to avoid (see `recoverPersistedSession` above). Preserving
 *     the row lets `recoverPersistedSession` rebuild the transport
 *     transparently on the consumer's next request. Accepted tradeoff:
 *     reaped rows linger in `mcp_sessions` until the age-based
 *     `MCP_SESSION_TTL_DAYS` pruner (`runMcpSessionPrune`, default 7
 *     days) catches them — rows are tiny (session_id / namespace /
 *     endpoint / a principal hash, no session state), so that lingering
 *     window is a storage non-issue, not a security concern (the
 *     principal hash still gates recovery). A dedicated shorter purge for
 *     specifically sweep-reaped rows is a named follow-up, not this PR.

 * Assemble the `GET /health/sessions` body. Pass `false` for `isAdmin` to

 * The route stays UNAUTHENTICATED and must — external monitors probe it and a
 * 401 would break them — so what it PUBLISHES is split by role instead. Every
 * caller gets `status: "ok"`, which is all a liveness probe consumes; the
 * detail is admin-only.
 *
 * That detail is live operational intel about this gateway. The session count
 * and the pool's idle/active split are its current scale and load; the
 * `publicSessionSweeper` block publishes the reap TTL, the sweep interval and
 * the running reap counters — i.e. precisely how long an abandoned session
 * survives, how often the gateway looks, and how many it is carrying right
 * now. Together those size a resource-exhaustion attempt against the backend
 * pool cap (the failure mode of the 2026-07-14 pool-cap outage) and
 * time it to land between sweeps. Served to anyone who could reach the host,
 * it was reconnaissance.
 *
 * Built additively rather than by deleting keys from a full body, matching
 * `buildUpstreamHealthBody` in ../../lib/health-upstream: a field added to
 * the block below cannot leak by someone forgetting to add it to a redaction
 * list. The early return also means an anonymous request never reads the
 * session manager, the pool or the sweeper at all.
 *
 * The admin half still never carries live session ids. An earlier version
 * returned `sessionIds: [...]` — every consumer's `Mcp-Session-Id` — and,
 * after that removal, re-published the same ids one level down by spreading
 * `getPoolStatus()` whole (it returns `activeSessionIds` +
 * `idleNamespaceUuids` alongside the counts). Both are projected out field by
 * field here so a field added to MetaMcpServerPoolStatus later cannot land in
 * this payload by default; `getPoolStatus` itself is deliberately left
 * intact.
