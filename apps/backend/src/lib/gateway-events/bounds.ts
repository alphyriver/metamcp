/**
 * Size and shape bounds for `gateway_events` (migration 0031) — everything
 * that decides how much one event may cost the archive, and how much one
 * filter may cost the database.
 *
 * Kept in its own DB-free module so both halves can import it (the writer in
 * `./sink`, the reader in `db/repositories/gateway-events.repo`) and so the
 * bounds themselves are unit-testable without a database anywhere in the
 * graph — the same reason `lib/audit/audit-emitter` keeps `clampAuditText`
 * beside the emitter rather than inside the repository.
 *
 * WHY BOUNDS AT ALL. A `gateway_events` row is immutable for 30 days, so its
 * SIZE is exactly as permanent as its contents for that whole window: nothing
 * can trim an oversized row, and the retention sweeper cannot reach it early.
 * Events are built from backend stderr, transport error text and connection
 * detail — none of which this gateway authors, and some of which an upstream
 * server can make arbitrarily long. Clamping at the writer is what stops one
 * event from costing the archive an unbounded amount.
 *
 * WHAT THESE BOUNDS DO NOT DO, stated plainly because the distinction is easy
 * to lose: they bound the size of a row, not the RATE of rows. A backend stuck
 * in a reconnect loop emits on every attempt, and a chatty STDIO backend emits
 * per stderr line, so row COUNT inside the 30-day window is bounded only by
 * how badly something upstream is behaving. Nothing here samples, dedupes or
 * throttles, and by design nothing can delete what it writes for 30 days. The
 * mitigations that do exist are indirect: retention caps total history at
 * `GATEWAY_EVENTS_RETENTION_DAYS`, and a backend flapping for weeks is a
 * failure an operator sees by other means long before storage is the symptom.
 * A sink-side rate limit is the obvious next step and is deliberately NOT here
 * — silently dropping events is the exact failure this table was added to end,
 * so which events may be dropped is a policy decision rather than an
 * implementation detail.

/**
 * 1024 for `message`.
 *
 * The messages this gateway writes are one-liners — "Connected after 3
 * attempts", "Transport closed unexpectedly (backend drop, 4m12s)" — and the
 * longest realistic one is a connect failure carrying an unwrapped undici
 * cause, which lands comfortably under 300 characters. 1024 keeps every real
 * message whole while capping the pathological case: a backend that writes a
 * megabyte of stderr in one line reaches `log-store.addLog` verbatim today.

 * than trusting each future call site to be tasteful. A value that does not
 * serialize, or that serializes past the bound, is dropped entirely rather
