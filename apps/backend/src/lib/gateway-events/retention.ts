/**
 * Retention policy for the gateway activity history (`gateway_events`,
 * migration 0031).
 *
 * TWO NUMBERS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A KNOB.
 *
 * The floor of 30 days is the requirement: at least 30 days of history that
 * cannot be rewritten or quietly trimmed. Migration 0031 enforces it from
 * underneath with an age-gated DELETE trigger, so it is not a policy this
 * module could relax even if it wanted to — a sweep that asked for anything
 * inside the window would raise rather than delete. Clamping here means the
 * application never asks.
 *
 * The retention period itself IS a knob (`GATEWAY_EVENTS_RETENTION_DAYS`,
 * default 90), because this table is high-volume operational history and a
 * deployment with a chatty estate has a legitimate reason to keep less of it.
 * What it does not have is a reason to keep less than the floor, so a value
 * below 30 is clamped UP with a WARN rather than honoured or rejected:
 * refusing to boot over a log-retention setting would be a worse failure than
 * keeping more history than asked, and honouring it silently would let a
 * config typo quietly delete the guarantee.
 *
 * NOTE THE ASYMMETRY WITH `TOOL_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`, which treats `<= 0` as
 * "retain forever". There is no such value here. Zero and negative numbers
 * clamp to the floor like any other under-range value, because "keep forever"
 * on a table with this write rate is an unbounded-growth setting, and the one
 * thing the floor must not permit is a way to end up with LESS than 30 days.
