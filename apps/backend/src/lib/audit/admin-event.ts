/**
 * Maps an admin/control-plane mutation onto an `audit_log` row.
 *
 * The success-path twin of `trpc-denial-sink.ts`: that one records the
 * attempts the RBAC gate REFUSED, this one records the ones it let through.
 * Until Phase 1B the second half was entirely missing — the config toggles
 * that decide whether anyone can register an account, the API-key mints, the
 * OAuth-client registrations and the account disable/enable switches all
 * happened without leaving a single durable row. The last investigation was
 * read from `app.log` and inference for exactly that reason.
 *
 * A pure mapping function, deliberately: it exists so ~25 call sites cannot
 * drift on `actor_type`, on which actor field goes in which column, or on
 * remembering that `emit` must not be awaited. It adds no infrastructure —
 * the pool, the sink and the swallow all belong to `audit-emitter.ts`.
 *
 * SAFETY. `emit` swallows every failure of its own, but it is handed a
 * finished object, so anything that throws while BUILDING that object throws
 * at the call site — inside the mutation, after the write, which would turn a
 * completed admin action into a 500. The row is therefore built inside a
 * try/catch here (optional chaining does NOT stop a throwing getter). Call
 * sites still owe the same care for the values they pass IN: a local or a
 * field off the row they just wrote, never an expression that can throw,
 * because that expression is evaluated before this function is entered.
 *
 * SECRETS. `detail` is persisted verbatim. Never put a credential in it — not
 * an API key, not a client secret, not a bearer token, not an MCP server's
 * vendor credentials. Ids, names, counts and old/new toggle values only; use
 * `credentialFingerprint()` from `audit-emitter.ts` when a credential has to
 * be correlatable across rows.
