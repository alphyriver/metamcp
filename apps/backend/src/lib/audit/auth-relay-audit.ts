/**
 * Turns one `/api/auth` relay round-trip into an `audit_log` row.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. better-auth is mounted in `index.ts` as a hand-rolled
 * Express → web-`Request` relay, and it emits nothing durable of its own. So
 * until Phase 1B a failed password attempt against this gateway left no
 * record anywhere — no row, no counter, nothing to alert on and nothing to
 * count after the fact. Sign-in failure is the credential-stuffing and
 * account-enumeration signal, and it is the one event in this file with no
 * database-hook equivalent: a refused sign-in creates no session, so
 * `databaseHooks.session.create.after` never fires for it.
 *
 * Extracted from `index.ts` rather than inlined so the mapping is directly
 * testable — importing `index.ts` boots the whole server graph. Same reason
 * `trpc-denial-sink.ts` is its own module.
 *
 * WHY ONLY `sign-in/email`, and not every `sign-in/*`. A 200 from
 * `sign-in/social` or `sign-in/oauth2` means "here is the URL to redirect the
 * browser to", NOT "these credentials were accepted" — treating its status as
 * a login outcome would write a successful-login row for a flow that has not
 * authenticated anybody yet. `sign-in/email` is the only sub-path where the
 * HTTP status genuinely IS the credential verdict. SSO logins are still
 * recorded: they mint a session, so `session.create` in `auth.ts` catches
 * them, which is exactly why that hook is wired as well as this wrap.
 *
 * SECRETS. The response body of a successful sign-in contains the SESSION
 * TOKEN. Only `user.id` and `user.email` are ever read out of it, never the
 * body itself, and the request body — which holds the submitted password — is
 * read only for `email`. An attempted email address is an identifier, not a
 * credential, and it is the entire value of a failure row: "someone tried
 * this account 400 times" is unanswerable without it.
 *
 * SIZE. That attempted address is attacker-controlled body text on a route
 * whose JSON limit is 50mb, so it is clamped to RFC 5321's 320-character
 * maximum address length before it reaches a column in a table with no
 * prune path. The row SIZE is bounded here; the row COUNT is bounded by
 * `middleware/auth-signin-rate-limit.middleware`, and both are needed. It is
 * NOT bounded by better-auth's own limiter — `auth.ts` pins that off, because
 * its address resolution puts every caller in one shared bucket behind this
 * deployment's proxy chain.
