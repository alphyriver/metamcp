/**
 * Per-request Graph token injection for M365-delegated backend servers.
 *
 * `client.ts` passes the fetch built here as the SDK transport's custom
 * `fetch` for any server whose name is in `M365_INJECTED_SERVER_NAMES`
 * (default: `m365`). Injection therefore rides the REQUEST, not the
 * connection — the only design that survives the pool's idle-warmup
 * handoff, per-server cap reuse and global params cache without ever
 * leaking one user's token into another user's traffic.
 *
 * THE INJECTION INVARIANT (unit-tested in `injected-fetch.test.ts`):
 *  1. The inbound consumer credential (MetaMCP-issued `mcp_token_*` or
 *     API key) is NEVER forwarded upstream — any Authorization header
 *     present on the outgoing request is stripped before injection.
 *     (MCP spec 2025-11-25 token-passthrough prohibition.)
 *  2. An Authorization header is set ONLY when a request-scoped user
 *     context exists (ALS, `request-context.ts`) AND the mint service
 *     returned a token for exactly that user. The mint service's sole
 *     token source is the Entra token endpoint for the configured
 *     tenant — the gateway only ever injects genuine Graph-scoped
 *     tokens (design doc §4.2 guarantee).
 *  3. No user context (idle warmup, health ping, API-key consumer,
 *     OpenAPI bridge) → the request goes out with NO Authorization at
 *     all. Fail-closed on identity; the backend's Graph call then
 *     fails per its own contract instead of acting as someone.
 *  4. Mint failures propagate as typed `M365BrokerError` so the proxy
 *     layer can answer the consumer with the enrollment elicitation.
