/**
 * Typed error surface for the M365 delegated-token broker.

 * tool result (and, when the consumer supports SEP-1036, a URL-mode
 * elicitation carrying the enrollment link) instead of an opaque 500.

 * Design doc: internal M365 delegated-MCP design, §4.3 (enrollment +
 * re-auth, lazy + elicitation-driven) and §5.5.
