 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the SDK's `Protocol.close()` only closes the LOCAL
 * transport — it never emits the spec DELETE, so every pool teardown left
 * the backend holding a live session object forever. Measured against a
 * live deployment: sessions were created and never terminated against a
 * single backend, roughly a megabyte retained each, walking that backend
 * into a slow OOM cycle.
 * The SDK ships `terminateSession()` for exactly this, but its only call
 * site was the admin-only Inspector DELETE route — never the production
 * pool.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN: a backend that is unreachable, hung, or answers
 * the DELETE with an error must never block or abort pool eviction, so
 * the call is bounded by `SESSION_TERMINATE_TIMEOUT_MS` and every failure
 * becomes exactly one WARN naming the server — surfaced, never swallowed
 * silently, never rethrown into the teardown path.
 *
 * SAFE TO CALL TWICE: STDIO and SSE transports carry no HTTP session and
 * no `terminateSession` method, so they short-circuit on the type check;
 * and the SDK clears its `_sessionId` after a successful DELETE while
 * `terminateSession()` returns immediately when there is no session id.
 * A double teardown (the same `ConnectedClient` reachable as both an idle
 * and an active slot during an invalidation cascade) therefore sends one
 * DELETE, not two. A FAILED DELETE deliberately leaves the session id in
 * place, so a later teardown retries it rather than orphaning the session.
