/**
 * The log store gained a second destination: every entry it rings also goes to
 * `gateway_events` (migration 0031) so the Live Logs view has a history that
 * survives a restart.
 *
 * Two properties are pinned here, and the second is the one that would hurt.
 *
 * COVERAGE BY CONSTRUCTION. The persistence call lives inside `record()`
 * rather than at each emitter, so a call site added later is durable without
 * anyone opting in. Testing it here is what stops a refactor from quietly
 * moving the write back out to the call sites.
 *
 * THE RING BUFFER DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE DATABASE. `record()` runs inside
 * transport error handlers and the connect retry loop. If a persistence
 * failure could break it, adding history would have made the live view — the
 * thing that already worked — fragile.
