/**
 * Detect errors that indicate the backend MCP server's session registry no
 * longer knows our Mcp-Session-Id. Per the MCP Streamable HTTP spec, the
 * backend SHOULD respond with HTTP 404 when it cannot find the session; most
 * SDKs also surface a JSON-RPC error body with code -32001 or -32600 and
 * message "Session not found".
 *
 * The MCP TypeScript SDK's StreamableHTTPClientTransport carries the HTTP
 * status in `.code` and the response body in its message. The SSE transport
 * embeds both in a generic Error. Example:
 *
 *   Error POSTing to endpoint (HTTP 404):
 *   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"server-error","error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Session not found"}}
 *
 * Production observation: in some flows the SDK error reaches us
 * wrapped (e.g. via `.cause` from a higher-layer handler, or stringified
 * after passing through a non-Error rejection). The simple
 * `error.message.includes(...)` check missed every event emitted between
 * a backend container restart and a manual MetaMCP restart, even though the
 * rendered string clearly contained all three matched substrings. To prevent
 * that gap from re-opening on the next backend deploy, this detector now:
 *
 *   1. Walks the `.cause` chain on Error inputs (max depth 8).
 *   2. Falls back to `String(error)` for non-Error throwables (some SDK
 *      paths reject with plain objects, McpError wrappers, or strings).
 *   3. Inspects a numeric/string `.code` field alongside the session-not-found
 *      message, including HTTP 404 responses with a plain-text body.
 *
 * When this fires, the cached backend connection is dead: MetaMCP must drop
 * it, send a new `initialize`, and replay the failed request. The MCP spec
 * states the client MUST start a new session in response to HTTP 404, so
 * this is the normative recovery path, not a workaround.
 *
 * Replay is for idempotent requests only. `tools/call` does not use this
 * detector to decide a replay; it uses the stricter
 * {@link isToolCallReplaySafeError} below, because a tool call can have side
 * effects and replaying one the backend already ran executes it twice.
 *
 * The -32001 code is overloaded. Backends answering an unknown
 * Mcp-Session-Id use it, and the MCP TypeScript SDK also uses it as
 * `ErrorCode.RequestTimeout`: every gateway-side request timeout rejects
 * with `McpError(-32001, "Request timed out")`, and an abort or a
 * `maxTotalTimeout` breach carries the same code. So the code is only ever a
 * confirming signal next to "Session not found", never a marker on its own.
 * Treating a bare -32001 as session-lost classed every 60 s timeout as a lost
 * session, and the tools/call path then re-sent the call. This latent gateway
 * retry was found while investigating a client-side double execution on
 * 2026-09-30.

 *
 * Production observation: a rapid-deploy cadence on a backend MCP server
 * (image pulls + container restarts inside a few minutes) produced
 * disconnect windows where the consumer-side connector saw
 * `-32603 "Not connected"` on every call. The session-lost detector
 * missed all of these; the recovery path in `metamcp-proxy.ts` never
 * fired — so a routine backend redeploy left the gateway needing a manual
 * reboot, which is not an acceptable operating cost. This detector + the
 * matching recovery wiring in `metamcp-proxy.ts` close that gap.

 * most a duplicate read. A tool call is not: it can delete a file on a
 * client endpoint, reboot a machine or reset a password, and replaying one
 * the backend already ran executes it twice and loses the first result. A
 * client-side double execution prompted an audit on 2026-09-30 that found a
 * separate gateway retry: a 60 s timeout (-32001) was classed as session-lost
 * and the call was re-sent. So this returns true only when the failure
 * PROVES the backend never executed the request:
 *
 *   1. The backend answered our POST with HTTP 404 "Session not found". Its
 *      session layer refused the request before any handler ran, which is
 *      the MCP spec's signal to re-initialize. Evidence is the transport's
 *      own HTTP status: `StreamableHTTPError.code === 404`, or the SSE
 *      transport's "Error POSTing to endpoint (HTTP 404)" message.
 *   2. Our transport was already closed before the request was sent: the
 *      SDK's pre-send `Error("Not connected")`, raised by `Protocol.request`
 *      when it has no transport and by the SSE / stdio `send` when there is
 *      no endpoint or process. Nothing left the gateway.
 *
 * Everything else surfaces to the caller with no replay, because the
 * request may have reached the backend: a timeout (McpError -32001 "Request
 * timed out"), a connection dropped mid-call (McpError -32000 "Connection
 * closed"), a fetch failure such as a reset socket, a 5xx, and any McpError
 * at all, since that is a JSON-RPC answer from a backend that received the
 * request (a nested gateway relaying "-32603 Not connected" included).
 *
 * Only the error exactly as `client.request()` rejects is inspected, with no
 * `.cause` walk and no status substring match: nothing wraps it on the
 * tools/call path, and a proof that has to be dug out of a wrapper or a
 * rendered string is not a proof. When the gateway cannot tell "never reached
 * the backend" from "sent and maybe executed", it must not replay. Do not
 * widen this to {@link isRecoverableBackendError}; that is the regression it
