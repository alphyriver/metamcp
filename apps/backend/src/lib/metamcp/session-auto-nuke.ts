/**
 * One-shot session nuke at metamcp boot, gated on detection of a
 * capability change relative to the persisted `mcp_sessions` rows.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * READ FIRST IF YOU'RE STUMBLING ON THIS FILE
 * ============================================================
 *
 * **Persistent sessions are the default + desired behavior.** PR #15
 * (`feat/lazy-session-recovery`) intentionally survives a metamcp
 * restart without forcing the consumer to reconnect: persisted rows
 * in `mcp_sessions` let the router rebuild the transport against the
 * same `Mcp-Session-Id` the client already has cached. 95%+ of
 * metamcp restarts (OAuth tweaks, dep bumps, transport-disconnect
 * detector work, lint sweeps, env-only changes) preserve the
 * advertised MCP server-capability set, and those restarts stay
 * fully transparent to consumers. This module does NOT touch those.
 *
 * The narrow case this module exists for: a deploy that ACTUALLY
 * changes the gateway's advertised MCP capabilities. Example: PR #19
 * added `tools: { listChanged: true }` to the upstream `Server`. MCP
 * `initialize` negotiates capabilities ONCE per session — a recovered
 * session keeps its pre-deploy cached capability set forever. PR #22
 * + PR #23 added stamps (`gateway_boot_id` + `capability_hash`) and
 * a `shouldRefuseRecovery` predicate that correctly returns 404 +
 * `Mcp-Session-Reinitialize-Required` when capabilities changed
 * across the restart. Spec-conformant clients respond by issuing a
 * fresh `initialize`.
 *
 * Anthropic's claude.ai MCP connector doesn't honor that spec
 * contract (already documented for PR #18) — it wraps the 404 +
 * reinit-required response as `-32600 "Anthropic Proxy: Invalid
 * content from server"`. Result: claude.ai sessions WEDGE
 * indefinitely after a capability-changing deploy until the row is
 * manually `DELETE`d from `mcp_sessions`.
 *
 * This module automates that manual workaround for the narrow case
 * only: on boot, if `mcp_sessions` contains any row whose
 * `capability_hash` differs from the current process's
 * `GATEWAY_CAPABILITY_HASH` (or is NULL — pre-PR-23 row), every
 * non-matching row is deleted in a single statement. The client's
 * NEXT request hits the new-session POST path instead of the
 * lazy-recovery refuse path, surfacing the Anthropic-side 404
 * mishandling at most once rather than indefinitely.
 *
 * **PR #23's `shouldRefuseRecovery` would have refused these rows
 * anyway** — the nuke is strictly a proactive form of the same
 * decision, only triggered for the rows that were guaranteed
 * unrecoverable. Rows whose capability_hash matches the current
 * process (i.e., 95%+ of restarts) are never touched.
 *
 * Remove this module when Anthropic's MCP connector ships
 * spec-compliant 404 handling.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * Operational behaviour
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Idempotency: re-running on a clean table (every row already
 * stamped with the current hash, or table empty) is a no-op. Two
 * restarts in a row do not loop.
 *
 * Env knob: `MCP_AUTO_NUKE_ON_CAPABILITY_CHANGE` (default "true").
 * Set to "false" for forensic-debugging boots where preserving stale
 * rows is more useful than cleaning them.
 *
 * Failure mode: any DB error is logged and swallowed — auto-nuke is
 * a workaround, not a correctness gate. Callers route this through
 * the existing startup try/catch (`apps/backend/src/index.ts`) so a
 * transient DB error doesn't crash the gateway.
