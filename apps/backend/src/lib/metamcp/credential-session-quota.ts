/**
 * Per-credential concurrent-session ceiling for the public MCP data plane.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Without a cap, one authenticated credential can open
 * sessions in a burst; once the shared backend pool saturates, its
 * capacity-eviction destroys other namespaces' live connections, degrading
 * every other consumer (the availability class of the July 2026 pool-cap
 * outage). This bounds how many concurrent sessions a single credential can
 * hold, enforced at session CREATION.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNT IS DERIVED, NOT MAINTAINED. Sessions live in two managers
 * (streamable-http + sse), each private to its router. Rather than each
 * creation/cleanup path incrementing and decrementing a counter here, where a
 * single missed decrement would leak the count upward and eventually LOCK OUT
 * a legitimate credential, turning an abuse guard into an availability bug,
 * the count is summed on demand across whatever managers register as counters.
 * The managers delete a session's binding on removeSession, so the derived
 * count is self-healing: it falls the moment a session ends, through every
 * cleanup path, without this module having to be told.
