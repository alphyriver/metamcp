/**
 * Adjudication hint on an SDK-shaped tools/call timeout.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS. When a backend tool call outlives the gateway's request timeout
 * (`MCP_TIMEOUT`, 60 s in production) the MCP SDK rejects with
 * `McpError(-32001, "Request timed out")`. That is the GATEWAY giving up waiting.
 * The SDK client also sends the backend a `notifications/cancelled` for the
 * request (protocol.js `cancel()`, the same function the timeout handler calls),
 * and a Python SDK backend acts on it by cancelling the handler. Whether that
 * cancel arrived before, during or after the work is not knowable here, so the
 * call's outcome is UNKNOWN: a write may have been applied, been cancelled
 * midway and be half applied, or still be finishing. The client only sees
 * "Request timed out", which reads as "it did not happen", so an agent retries,
 * and a retried write can run twice (the gateway itself never re-sends a
 * timed-out tools/call).
 *
 * The hint states only what is true whoever raised the timeout: the call timed
 * out and its outcome is unknown. It names no actor. A backend can return the
 * same -32001 "Request timed out" with the same `data` shape (Sol review
 * 2026-10-02, reproduced through real SDK transports), so a claim that the
 * GATEWAY stopped waiting and asked the backend to cancel could be false, and so
 * could the seconds in `data`. Earlier wordings ("it did not cancel the call",
 * then "the gateway stopped waiting after N s and asked the backend to cancel")
 * each claimed more than is knowable here.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHANGES: text only. The same error code (-32001), the same `data`,
 * and the original message kept as its first sentence, with added text saying
 * the outcome is unknown and that a caller of a tool that changes anything
 * should read the target's state before retrying. Clients
 * that branch on the code, or match "Request timed out", behave exactly as
 * before. Nothing about routing, retry or what the backend sees changes.
 *
 * WHAT IT MATCHES, narrowly. The SDK's two timeout message/data shapes:
 * "Request timed out" (carrying `data.timeout`) and "Maximum total timeout
 * exceeded" (carrying `data.maxTotalTimeout`). The code -32001 is overloaded: a
 * backend answering an unknown session id also uses it, with no such data and a
 * different message, and that answer must never be described as a timeout.
 * A backend timeout with the SDK's shape also matches; provenance is unknown.
 *
 * It sits innermost, directly around the routing handler, so the audit
 * middleware (outermost) still records the same numeric code, and an error that
 * was already replay-safe-classified inside the handler is not touched.
