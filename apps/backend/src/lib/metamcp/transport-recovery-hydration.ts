/**
 * Session-state hydration for lazy-recovered StreamableHTTP transports.
 *
 * Background — the bug this fixes:
 *
 * Lazy session recovery (PR #15) rebuilds a `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`
 * for a sessionId a client cached in a PRIOR metamcp process (so the
 * client's `Mcp-Session-Id` survives a gateway restart). The rebuild
 * connects a pooled `Server` to a fresh transport — but the MCP
 * `initialize` handshake is never replayed, because the MCP lifecycle
 * sends `initialize` exactly ONCE per client session and a reconnecting
 * client won't send it again.
 *
 * As of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.29.0 the Node
 * `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` is a thin wrapper that delegates all
 * session state to an inner `_webStandardTransport`
 * (`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`). That inner transport
 * flips `_initialized=true` and assigns `sessionId` ONLY inside the
 * initialize-request branch of `server/webStandardStreamableHttp.js`
 * (`this.sessionId = this.sessionIdGenerator?.(); this._initialized =
 * true`). A rebuilt-but-not-initialized transport therefore rejects the
 * client's first real request in the inner `validateSession`:
 *
 *     if (!this._initialized) -> 400 {-32000 "Bad Request: Server not
 *     initialized"}   (webStandardStreamableHttp.js validateSession)
 *
 * (In SDK 1.16 these same fields lived directly on the Node transport;
 * 1.29 moved them one level down into `_webStandardTransport`, so the
 * hydration and its contract check reach through that wrapper. Re-verified
 * unchanged against the installed 1.30.0 build during that bump: the Node
 * wrapper still constructs `_webStandardTransport` in its own constructor,
 * the inner transport still sets `_initialized = false` there, and still
 * assigns `this.sessionId` / `this._initialized = true` only in the
 * initialize branch that `validateSession` gates on.)
 *
 * The Anthropic claude.ai MCP connector relays that 400 as
 * `-32600 "Anthropic Proxy: Invalid content from server"`, wedging the
 * connector until a full client refresh (which drops the cached
 * sessionId and forces a fresh `initialize`). A `/mcp` reconnect does
 * NOT clear it — it reuses the same cached sessionId and hits the same
 * dead transport. (Root-caused against a live deployment: every stored
 * `mcp_sessions` row carried the current capability_hash, so the
 * PR #22/#23/#24 capability machinery was never the cause — recovery was
 * "succeeding" and then 400-ing on the first call.)
 *
 * The caller checks `shouldRefuseRecovery` (capability_hash match) before
 * rebuilding, which proves the client's cached protocol + capability
 * negotiation still matches what this process advertises. Replaying the
 * handshake would therefore be redundant; we just restore the two fields
 * it would have set.
 *
 * Remove this shim if the SDK ever exposes a public API to construct a
 * transport in an already-initialized state for an existing sessionId.
