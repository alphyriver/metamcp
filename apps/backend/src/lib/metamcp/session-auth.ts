 * The `mcp_sessions` table stores a SHA-256 hash of the auth credential
 * (bearer token or API key) plus a method discriminator so two clients
 * authenticating against the same endpoint with different credentials
 * can't accidentally share a session.
 *
 * Raw tokens are NEVER persisted. Comparison is constant-time via
 * `crypto.timingSafeEqual` so a timing oracle can't leak the stored
 * hash. The hash is one-way; even a full DB compromise reveals only
 * "someone with a token whose SHA-256 looks like X" — not the token
 * itself.
 *
 * Token rotation / revocation invalidates the recovery path: a new
 * token produces a new hash, the stored principal no longer matches,
 * the router refuses the lazy-recovery and the client must reinit
 * (which persists the new principal). That's the intended behavior —
 * a revoked token must not survive a metamcp restart.

 *
 * GRANULARITY, which is a deliberate choice per auth method rather than an
 * oversight:
 *
 *  - api_key -> the KEY uuid. Two keys owned by the same user are two
 *    credentials, and one must not inherit the other's session. This is as
 *    tight as the token hash in practice, since a key's secret is not
 *    rotatable in place.
 *
 *  - oauth -> the USER id, deliberately NOT the token. An access token lives
 *    24h and a connector refreshes it while holding the same `Mcp-Session-Id`;
 *    binding to the token would force a re-initialize on every refresh for a
 *    caller who is plainly the same principal. The access-control question is
 *    "is this the same principal", and the user id answers exactly that.
 *
 * WHY A MISSING `authMethod` RESOLVES TO ANONYMOUS rather than to the
 * never-matching identity `identityMatches` gives a null `credentialId` on an
 * authenticated method. `anonymous` is not a fallback here, it is the answer
 * for the one shape that legitimately has no method: an endpoint published
 * through `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_ENDPOINTS`, where CONDITION 1 requires BOTH
 * auth toggles off, so such an endpoint is either all-anonymous or
 * all-credentialed and the two identities never meet on one endpoint. On a
 * credentialed endpoint the case is unreachable: every success branch of
 * `authenticateApiKey` stamps `authMethod` plus `apiKeyUuid` or `oauthUserId`
 * before calling `next()`. That coupling is what makes this safe, so it is
 * pinned directly rather than assumed — see
 * `middleware/api-key-identity-stamp.test.ts`, which drives the real
 * middleware and fails if a stamp is ever dropped.
