/**
 * The CONTROL-plane (admin-plane, migration 0038) bearer resolver for `/trpc`.
 *
 * This is the module `createContext` reaches through a LAZY dynamic import, the
 * same way it reaches the disabled-account check: it touches the repositories
 * and thus `db/index`, so a top-level import here would make `trpc.ts`
 * un-loadable without a database, and error-formatter.test.ts imports `trpc.ts`
 * with `../auth` mocked precisely because the tRPC instance is independent of
 * all that. Deferring the import keeps that true; the database is touched when a
 * BEARER request arrives, not when the router is defined.
 *
 * WHY A SYNTHETIC SESSION IS SAFE. Nothing downstream reads a session field:
 * protectedProcedure only tests `!ctx.session` for truthiness, and no impl reads
 * `ctx.session.*`. The synthesized session is truthy, carries an explicit
 * `token: "admin-plane-key"` marker so a heap dump names its origin, and is
 * never written to the sessions table. The owning user's RBAC is what gates what
 * the request may then do: `user.role` is read FRESH from the joined users row
 * per request, so a demoted owner's key degrades to member on the very next
 * request and adminProcedure returns FORBIDDEN, the column, not the key, is the
 * lever.
