/**
 * The origin allowlist every CREDENTIALED CORS surface on this gateway shares,
 * plus the `/api/auth` policy built on top of it.
 *
 * Two `cors()` shorthands must never appear on a route that answers to a
 * session cookie. `origin: "*"` emits the literal wildcard, which browsers
 * refuse to pair with credentials at all — so it is a policy that says
 * "anyone" while delivering nothing, and it hides the fact that no deliberate
 * policy was ever chosen. `origin: true` is worse: it reflects whatever
 * `Origin` the caller sent, so `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` becomes
 * attacker-controlled and, with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
 * beside it, any site the victim visits can read a cookie-authenticated
 * response. Routes that need credentials call in here instead and get back a
 * specific, known origin or no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` at all.
 *
 * The allowlist reads the same two environment variables better-auth's own
 * `trustedOrigins` is built from in ../auth, rather than importing that module:
 * `auth.ts` constructs the drizzle adapter at import time and throws without a
 * database, and a CORS decision must not be able to drag postgres into a
 * router's import graph.
 *
 * The two lists are NOT equivalent, deliberately. better-auth's is nine
 * hardcoded loopback origins plus `EXTRA_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, with `APP_URL`
 * trusted separately as its `baseURL` rather than as a list member. This one
 * is `APP_URL` plus `EXTRA_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, and it admits loopback ONLY when
 * `APP_URL` is itself loopback — so on a deployed gateway it is STRICTER than
 * better-auth's, which keeps trusting `http://localhost:3000` in production.
 * That divergence is the point: better-auth's list gates CSRF on requests the
 * caller already has a cookie for, while this one decides who may READ a
 * credentialed response.

 *
 * The scheme check is not cosmetic. WHATWG gives every NON-special scheme an
 * opaque origin, which `URL.origin` serialises as the literal string "null" —
 * so `app://anything`, `moz-extension://anything`, `file://` and `data:` all
 * normalise to the SAME value. Without this guard, one exotic-scheme entry in
