 * WHY THIS SITS IN `lib/` RATHER THAN BESIDE THE MIDDLEWARE THAT INTRODUCED IT.
 * It was defined in `middleware/audit-context.middleware`, which is still where
 * the trust assumption and the `trust proxy` decision are written down at
 * length — read that first. It moved here because it stopped being an audit
 * concern: the rate limiters key on it too, and `lib/auth-rate-limiter` is a
 * `lib/` module. `middleware/` imports `lib/` throughout this codebase and
 * `lib/` imports `middleware/` nowhere, so importing upward would have made
 * those two directories mutually dependent — the shape that turns into a real
 * import cycle the first time anything else is added. `audit-context.middleware`
 * re-exports both names, so existing importers are unaffected.

/**
 * Pull the caller IP out of a header bag.
 *
 * Exported for tests. Returns undefined rather than a placeholder when the
 * header is absent (direct-to-origin calls, local development): a NULL
 * `actor_ip` is an honest "not known", while a fabricated one would be read
 * as evidence. Callers that need a key rather than a record — the rate
 * limiters — supply their own fallback instead.
 *
 * CLAMPED HERE, at the stamping site, rather than at each emitter. Every audit
 * row's `actor_ip` and every `x-audit-client-ip` the `/api/auth` relay stamps
 * are read from `auditClientIp`, so bounding it once here bounds all of them,
 * and a future emitter cannot forget to. See AUDIT_IP_MAX in
 * `lib/audit/audit-emitter` for why 64 loses no evidence.
 *
 * WHAT THE CLAMP DOES AND DOES NOT BUY THE LIMITERS THAT KEY ON THIS. It
 * bounds per-key SIZE, not key COUNT. A caller rotating the header still mints
 * one map entry per distinct value — measured at 200k entries for 200k values
 * — and those are reclaimed only by the ten-minute sweep in
 * `lib/auth-rate-limiter`. What bounds the count is the edge overwriting the
 * header, plus that sweep; it is not this line.
