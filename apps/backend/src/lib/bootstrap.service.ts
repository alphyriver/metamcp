 * ordering inside a single boot can keep bootstrap out of its own refusal. The
 * actual fix is the bootstrap exemption in
 * `lib/bootstrap-signup-override.ts`: the entrypoint opens it around the
 * bootstrap user pass and closes it in a `finally`, so bootstrap can create (or
 * recreate) its administrators no matter what the stored flag says, while every
 * request that arrives over HTTP still meets the closed gate.
 *
 * CALL THIS AFTER `bootstrapUsers` ANYWAY. The ordering is no longer what
 * carries the property, but it is the cheap second line: it keeps the stored
 * flag from moving until the accounts this boot is responsible for exist, so a
 * future change that drops or misplaces the exemption degrades to a failed
 * first boot rather than to a delete-then-refuse on an established deploy.
 * There is no reachable gap either way: the whole sequence runs inside
 * `initializeOnStartup()`, which `index.ts` awaits BEFORE `app.listen()`, so no
 * request can arrive while any of it is in flight.
 *
 * These two writes are the same authority as the admin UI's signup toggles,
 * exercised by the environment instead of by a person: a container restart
 * carrying a changed (or newly absent) BOOTSTRAP_DISABLE_REGISTRATION_* can
 * flip who may create an account, and until now it did so with no durable
 * evidence at all, the only trace being the config row's `updated_at`. They
 * therefore emit the SAME per-key `config.*.set` actions the UI setters emit
 * (`trpc/config.impl.ts`), so an investigation reads one timeline instead of
 * correlating audit rows against container logs. `source: "bootstrap_env"` is
 * what separates the two origins; the absent actor is what makes the row
 * `actor_type: "system"` rather than a phantom administrator.
 *
 * Only a genuine CHANGE is recorded. Bootstrap re-asserts both flags on EVERY
 * start, so emitting unconditionally would bury the one restart that moved a
 * flag under a row per restart that did not.
