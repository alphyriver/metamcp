 * does so with no visible cause, because a housekeeping sweep is not what
 * anyone looks at when a process refuses to exit. The HTTP server in `index.ts`
 * is what keeps this service running; nothing here should.

 * `isCurrentlyLimited` docblock in the module under test, which exists because
 * of exactly that), so two counts landed per failure and refusal arrived on the
