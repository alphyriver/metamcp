/**
 * A tripwire wired to nothing is the failure this whole module exists to
 * prevent, and it is the one failure its own unit suite cannot catch: every
 * case in `tripwire.test.ts` calls `checkAuditStorage()` directly, so all of
 * them stay green after the call site is deleted from the sweep.
 *
 * The sweep itself is not unit-testable, because `routers/oauth/index.ts`
 * opens a pool and starts an interval at import, so this reads its source.
 * Same technique as the `cors()` call-site guard in
 * `routers/cors-policy.test.ts`.
