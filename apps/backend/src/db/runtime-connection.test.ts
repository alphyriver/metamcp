/**
 * The runtime/migration credential split, at the two places it can go wrong.
 *
 * First: the resolver. The property that has to hold above every other is that
 * an UNCONFIGURED deployment gets byte-identical behaviour — the moment this
 * indirection changes what a stock stack dials, it has broken every existing
 * install to buy a feature nobody asked for yet.
 *
 * Second: `scripts/ensure-runtime-role.sh`. It runs against a real server, so
 * most of it needs a database (see ./ensure-runtime-role.integration.test.ts).
 * What can be asserted without one is the part that rots silently: the list of
 * audit tables whose mutation grants get revoked. `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`
 * in that script hands full DML on every FUTURE table to the runtime role, so
 * an audit table added by a later migration is UPDATE-able unless someone
 * remembers to add it. The last case here removes "remembers" from that
 * sentence.
