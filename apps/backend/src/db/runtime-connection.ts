/**
 * Which connection string the RUNNING gateway dials, as opposed to the one
 * `drizzle-kit migrate` dials.
 *
 * WHY THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT AT ALL. On the stock compose stack they are the
 * same string, and it belongs to the `postgres:16-alpine` bootstrap role — a
 * SUPERUSER. Superusers bypass GRANTs, and can turn a trigger off for their
 * own session or drop it outright, so the append-only triggers migration 0028
 * installs on `audit_log` are bypassable by the credential the app holds every
 * second it is running. Migrations genuinely need that privilege (they create
 * and alter tables). The request path does not. Splitting them is what makes
 * the word "immutable" true rather than aspirational.
 *
 * OPT-IN, AND BYTE-IDENTICAL WHEN OFF. With neither variable set this returns
 * DATABASE_URL and the mode `"unsplit"`, which is exactly what both pools read
 * before this module existed. No deployment changes behaviour on upgrade.
 *
 * NO SILENT FALLBACK. When the split IS configured and the configuration is
 * unusable (an unparseable DATABASE_URL, an empty role name) this THROWS.
 * Quietly falling back to the superuser string would leave an operator who
 * believes the split is on running with it off — the one outcome worse than
 * not shipping the feature.
