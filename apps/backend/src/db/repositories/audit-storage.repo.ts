/**
 * Storage statistics for the three audit tables, for the growth tripwire in
 * `lib/audit-storage/tripwire`.
 *
 * WHY AN ESTIMATE RATHER THAN A COUNT, and it is the whole reason this file
 * exists instead of three `SELECT count(*)`. Two of these tables carry a
 * 30-day immutability window (migrations 0031 and 0032), so the worst case
 * this monitor exists to catch is tens of millions of rows a day that no
 * application path can reclaim early. `count(*)` on such a table is a
 * sequential scan of exactly the thing that got too big: the monitor's cost
 * would grow with the problem, and the first place it would stall is the
 * five-minute sweep it rides. `pg_class.reltuples` is a catalog column the
 * planner already maintains and `pg_total_relation_size` is a stat of the
 * relation's files, so this stays a fixed-cost read no matter how large the
 * tables get.
 *
 * ONE QUERY, THREE ROWS, ALWAYS THREE. The table names are a VALUES list on
 * the LEFT of the join, so a table that does not resolve still comes back as a
 * row with null figures rather than silently dropping out of the result. A
 * monitor that reports two tables when it was asked about three has lost the
 * one that mattered without saying so.
 *
 * WHICH POOL, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE MAIN ONE. This runs on `gatewayEventsDb`,
 * the bounded two-connection pool with a 1s checkout timeout and a 5s
 * server-side statement timeout (`../gateway-events-db`). The main pool sets
 * neither, so a checkout there queues indefinitely; a stats read awaited inside
 * the cleanup interval could then hold the sweep open for as long as the
 * database stayed saturated, which turns a monitor into an outage amplifier.
 * Failing fast and logging is the correct behaviour for a diagnostic: a missed
 * hourly reading costs an hour of visibility, a stalled sweep costs retention.
 *
 * BOTH timeouts are load-bearing here and the second is the less obvious one.
 * This query touches no table data, but `pg_total_relation_size` still takes
 * ACCESS SHARE, which conflicts with the ACCESS EXCLUSIVE held by a migration,
 * a `VACUUM FULL`, or the break-glass `DISABLE TRIGGER` in the README. Blocked
 * on that lock the statement waits as long as the lock lives, holding a
 * connection the writer needs, and the checkout timeout cannot help because
 * the connection was already checked out. `statement_timeout` is what bounds
 * it.
 *
 * NOT the audit pool, for the reason `../audit-db` spells out at length:
 * `audit_log` is the security record, it has no prune path, and a write that
 * never happens can never be recovered. An hourly diagnostic has no business
 * competing for the two connections that record a refused credential.
 *
 * Note the contrast with `gateway-events.repo`, which deliberately keeps its
 * prune and its admin reads OFF this pool. Those are unbounded work whose
 * duration scales with the table (a DELETE across millions of rows, a page of
 * history with a substring filter), and either could occupy a connection long
 * enough to matter to the writer that depends on it. This is a three-row
 * catalog lookup once an hour, and the pool's statement timeout caps what it
 * can hold at five seconds even when it is blocked rather than working. The
 * rule that pool's comment is really stating is "nothing that can hold a
 * connection", and this is bounded so it cannot.
