/**
 * `audit_log` is append-only, and this proves it two ways.
 *
 * The operator requirement behind this is an audit archive
 * with NO application or admin path that empties it. Two things enforce that:
 * a repository with no delete/update/prune method (audit-log.repo.ts), and the
 * database triggers migration 0028 installs. The repository half is enforced
 * by its own absence; this file covers the database half.
 *
 * Layer 1 (always runs): the migration SQL and the drizzle journal are
 * asserted directly. A migration whose journal entry does not out-rank the
 * previous max is SILENTLY SKIPPED by drizzle — the table would simply never
 * exist in production and nothing would fail loudly — so the ordering is
 * checked as a test, not trusted to review.
 *
 * Layer 2 (opt-in via TEST_DATABASE_URL): the triggers are exercised against a
 * REAL Postgres. A trigger that exists in a .sql file and a trigger that
 * actually refuses a DELETE are different claims, and only the second one is
 * worth anything the morning after an attack.
 *
 *   docker run -d --name metamcp-audit-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
 *     -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_DB=metamcp_test \
 *     -p 127.0.0.1:55433:5432 postgres:16-alpine
 *   cd apps/backend
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:55433/metamcp_test \
 *     npx drizzle-kit migrate
 *   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:55433/metamcp_test \
 *     npx vitest run src/db/repositories/audit-log-immutability.integration.test.ts
 *
 * NOTE for whoever runs layer 2: the rows this suite inserts CANNOT be cleaned
 * up afterwards. That is not an oversight — it is the property under test.
 * Point it at a disposable database.
