/**
 * REAL-POSTGRES integration test for the DCR client retention sweep,
 * `oauthRepository.pruneUnusedClients`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The sweep is the only DELETE in this codebase that
 * runs unattended, on a timer, against rows a customer integration depends on.
 * Its entire correctness is in a four-predicate WHERE clause — a provenance
 * equality, a timestamp comparison, and two NOT EXISTS anti-joins — and the
 * suite that covered it (../../routers/oauth/client-retention.test.ts) replaces
 * the whole repository with `vi.fn()`. That suite pins the window resolution
 * and the never-throws contract, which is real value, but it cannot tell you
 * whether the statement deletes the right rows; a mock returns whatever the
 * test author imagined. Getting the direction of the `created_at` comparison
 * backwards, or dropping the provenance check, both leave it green.
 *
 * What is asserted here is one table of cases against one real statement:
 * which rows survive a sweep, and which do not.
 *
 * GATING: opt-in via TEST_DATABASE_URL, and deliberately NOT via DATABASE_URL,
 * for the reason spelled out at the top of ./access-queries.integration.test.ts
 * — this suite deletes rows, and pointing it at a database has to be an
 * explicit act rather than a side effect of having a connection string
 * exported. Same setup:
 *
 *   docker run -d --name metamcp-access-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
 *     -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_DB=metamcp_test \
 *     -p 127.0.0.1:55432:5432 postgres:16-alpine
 *   cd apps/backend
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:55432/metamcp_test \
 *     npx drizzle-kit migrate
 *   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:55432/metamcp_test \
 *     npx vitest run src/db/repositories/client-retention.integration.test.ts
