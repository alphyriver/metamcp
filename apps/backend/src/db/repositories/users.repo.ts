/**
 * The admin user listing, as a query builder rather than an executed query,
 * so its SQL can be asserted without a database.
 *
 * The counts are CORRELATED SUBQUERIES rather than LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY on
 * purpose: three independent one-to-many joins against the same driving table
 * multiply each other's rows, so a user with 2 sessions and 3 keys would
 * report 6 of each. Subqueries keep every count independent, and each
 * predicate is indexed (`sessions.user_id` is the FK,
 * `oauth_access_tokens_user_id_idx`, `api_keys_user_id_idx`,
 * `api_keys_acts_as_user_id_idx`).
 *
 * `now` is captured once by the caller and passed into all the liveness
 * predicates, so one user's counts are consistent with each other instead of
 * being evaluated at three slightly different instants.
 *
 * DRIVER DECODERS ARE LOAD-BEARING on every raw `sql` fragment here, and this
 * is the single sharpest edge in the file. Interpolating a subquery into a
 * raw fragment discards the decoder drizzle would have taken from the column
 * type, so node-postgres returns its WIRE representation: `count(*)` is
 * bigint and arrives as a STRING, `max(timestamptz)` arrives as a STRING.
 * The TypeScript type still claims `number` / `Date`, so nothing fails to
 * compile — the failure lands at runtime in the router's `.output()` schema
 * ("expected date, received string") and takes the whole listing with it.
 * `.mapWith(Number)` / `.mapWith(sessionsTable.updatedAt)` reattach the
 * decoders. Verified against a real postgres in
 * access-queries.integration.test.ts; do not remove either without running
 * that suite.
 *
 * An explicit column list is used, never `select()` — the serializer is the
 * redaction boundary, but not pulling columns nobody asked for is the cheaper
 * first layer.

   *     mint path already treats that status as missing (so access stops
   *     now), and the row stays as an audit record of the enrollment.
   *   - OAuth tokens are deleted regardless of expiry. An expired ACCESS
