/**
 * `tool_call_audit` is immutable for 30 days and prunable after, and this
 * proves it two ways.
 *
 * The requirement behind the table is at least 30 days of in-platform log
 * history that cannot be rewritten or quietly trimmed. This table was the last
 * one not honouring it: `audit_log` has been append-only since migration 0028,
 * but nothing constrained this one, so the DELETE its retention pruner needs
 * was an unrestricted DELETE and the credential serving requests could empty
 * the table rather than prune its aged tail. Migration 0032 makes the
 * difference a 30-day window, and a window has an edge that can be got wrong
 * in both directions. Both directions are tested here: a young row must
 * survive every removal attempt, and an aged row must actually be deletable or
 * retention becomes a recurring exception on a five-minute timer.
 *
 * Layer 1 (always runs): the migration SQL and the drizzle journal are
 * asserted directly. A migration whose journal entry does not out-rank the
 * previous max is SILENTLY SKIPPED by drizzle, so the triggers would simply be
 * absent in production with nothing failing loudly. The ordering is checked as
 * a test, not trusted to review.
 *
 * Layer 2 (opt-in via TEST_DATABASE_URL): the triggers are exercised against a
 * REAL Postgres. A trigger that exists in a .sql file and a trigger that
 * actually refuses a DELETE are different claims, and only the second one is
 * worth anything to whoever is reading this table after a credential was
 * misused.
 *
 *   docker run -d --name metamcp-toolaudit-test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
 *     -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_DB=metamcp_test \
 *     -p 127.0.0.1:55492:5432 postgres:16-alpine

 *     npx vitest run src/db/repositories/tool-call-audit-immutability.integration.test.ts
 *
 * NOTE for whoever runs layer 2: the young rows this suite inserts CANNOT be
 * cleaned up afterwards. That is not an oversight, it is the property under
 * test. Point it at a disposable database.
