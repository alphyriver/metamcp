# Runs AFTER migrations and BEFORE either server process starts, and that order
# is the whole design. Migrations are DDL and need the owner/superuser
# credential in DATABASE_URL; the running gateway does not, and holding it is
# what lets a compromised gateway rewrite its own audit trail (superusers
# bypass GRANTs and can disable or drop a trigger). Granting after the
# migration also means a table a migration created seconds ago is already in
# `ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public` when the grants run.
#
# Unset METAMCP_RUNTIME_DB_PASSWORD = the split is off and this is a no-op, so
# an existing deployment behaves exactly as before on upgrade. A FAILURE here
# is fatal on purpose: the alternative is booting with the superuser credential
# while the operator believes the split is on.

    # would grant privileges nothing uses, and letting the script refuse it

# Umbrella fork: white-label branding aliases.
#
# The frontend reads branding through next-runtime-env, which only republishes
# NEXT_PUBLIC_-prefixed vars to the browser — and the sidebar brand is a client
# component, so the canonical names must carry that prefix. Operators should
# not have to care, so accept the short BRANDING_* names too and promote them
# here. Doing it in the entrypoint (rather than in docker-compose.yml) means it
# works for `docker run -e`, Kubernetes, and compose alike, and it happens
# before either server process starts — so the server render and the client
# hydration can never resolve different brands. Any NON-EMPTY NEXT_PUBLIC_
# value wins; an explicitly-empty one is treated as unset and the alias still
# promotes, matching resolveBrandText's empty-means-unset rule. Unset aliases
# are a no-op.
